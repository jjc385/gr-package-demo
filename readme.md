# gr-package-demo

Demonstration of my GR 'package', introducing a framework for dealing with indices.

I made no attempts to clean this up -- I just saved my notebook as a package
file to share it.

Hopefully I will improve upon this and make it more readable later.

Of course this package is far from perfect.  
Unfortunately my research focus has shifted and I don't do much work in
(classical) GR any longer, so I have fairly little incentive to improve it
much, though doing so does remain a long-term interest of mine.

## Structure

* The main index structure is introduced in the section Setup -> Definitions.
* Some helper functions precede these definitions.
* After the definitions come some applications -- (incomplete) machinery for
computing Ricci tensors and such.
* Some examples (mostly testing Ricci machinery, but this also demonstrates the
  index structure)

## Context

I initially uploaded this package in answering 
[this mathematic.stackexchange question](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/158444/a-simple-implementation-of-higher-spin-calculus-explanation-given).
The package is (hopefully) better explained in [my answer there](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/a/158527/11035).
This repo is merely to serve as a reference to clarify my
meaning and implementation.
